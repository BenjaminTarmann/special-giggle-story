	There once was a man named Segel, who had quite the special giggle. It was the kind of giggle that everyone loved
to hear. Every time Segel would go to a party, everyone would tell him jokes just to hear that giggle. 
        However Segal do not like that giggle, he feels embarraased everytime his friends laugh at him. So one day he went to a wizard to ask him to change his giggle so it would not be so special.
	The wizard accepted his request and his giggle got changed, however, Segal is not sure he likes his new giggle. 
	Now no one likes Segel at all. It turns out the only thing people ever liked about him was his giggle.
